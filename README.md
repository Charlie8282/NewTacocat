This is an application that accepts one user input of a word or phrase with no spaces or characters other than letters.  The user inputs a word and the program runs when the button is clicked to determine if the given word was a palindrome or not.

1.  Type your desired word or phrase into the input box provided.
2.  Click the button that says "Flip."
3.  A modal will inform you if that is a palindrome or not, and then print the word you gave in reverse spelling in the column next to the button.
